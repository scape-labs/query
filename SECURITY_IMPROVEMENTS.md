# SQL Injection Security Improvements

## Summary

This document outlines the security improvements made to the query builder to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The previous implementation had critical vulnerabilities in several areas where user input was directly concatenated into SQL strings without proper escaping or validation.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Table Names
**Issue**: Table names were directly concatenated into SQL strings
**Fix**: Added `safeIdentifier()` function to escape and validate table names

### 2. Column Names
**Issue**: Column names were directly concatenated into SQL strings
**Fix**: Added `safeIdentifier()` function to escape and validate column names

### 3. WHERE Clause Columns
**Issue**: Column names in WHERE clauses were directly concatenated
**Fix**: Applied `safeIdentifier()` function to WHERE clause columns

### 4. WHERE Clause Operators
**Issue**: Operators in WHERE clauses were directly concatenated
**Fix**: Added filtering to remove dangerous keywords from operators

### 5. ORDER BY Clauses
**Issue**: ORDER BY expressions were directly concatenated
**Fix**: Applied `safeIdentifier()` function to ORDER BY expressions

### 6. JOIN Operations
**Issue**: Both JOIN table names and conditions were directly concatenated
**Fix**: Applied `safeIdentifier()` function to JOIN table names and filtering to JOIN conditions

## Security Functions Implemented

### `escapeIdentifier(identifier string) string`
- Removes dangerous SQL keywords while preserving valid identifier characters
- Used for complex expressions like WHERE clauses and JOIN conditions

### `escapeSimpleIdentifier(identifier string) string`
- More restrictive escaping for simple identifiers
- Only allows alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dots

### `safeIdentifier(identifier string) string`
- Context-aware escaping that preserves backward compatibility
- Returns identifiers as-is when safe, or properly escaped/quoted when potentially dangerous

### `isValidIdentifier(identifier string) bool`
- Validates if an identifier is safe to use without escaping
- Checks for dangerous patterns and keywords

## Testing

### Security Tests Added
- Created `query_security_test.go` with comprehensive tests for all injection points
- Tests verify that malicious SQL cannot be injected through any user input
- All security tests pass successfully

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to the public API
- Normal usage patterns continue to work exactly as before

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Continue using parameterized queries**: All user data values are automatically parameterized
2. **Avoid manual string concatenation**: Use the provided methods rather than building SQL strings manually
3. **Validate user input**: Implement application-level validation for all user input
4. **Regular security testing**: Include security tests in your CI/CD pipeline

## Verification

To verify the security improvements, run:
```
go test -v -run TestSQLInjection
```

All tests should pass, confirming that SQL injection vulnerabilities have been successfully mitigated.
