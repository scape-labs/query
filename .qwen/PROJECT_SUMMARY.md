# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To enhance a Go SQL query builder library with relationship functionality (JOIN operations) while maintaining backward compatibility and comprehensive test coverage.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology**: Go programming language with a focus on SQL query building
- **Package**: `github.com/scape-labs/query` - a fluent SQL query builder
- **Core Features**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations with parameter binding and different placeholder styles
- **New Relationship Features**: JOIN operations (JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, INNER JOIN, FULL JOIN) with table aliasing support
- **Architecture**: Fluent interface design pattern with method chaining
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with unit tests and benchmarks
- **Build Commands**: `go build .`, `go test`, `go fmt .`
- **Parameter Styles**: QuestionMark (`?`) and DollarNumber (`$1, $2`) formats

## Recent Actions
- Implemented comprehensive relationship functionality by adding JOIN operations to the query builder
- Added `JoinClause` struct to represent JOIN operations with fields for Type, Table, Alias, and Condition
- Extended `QueryBuilder` struct with `joinClauses` and `tableAlias` fields
- Added JOIN methods: `Join`, `LeftJoin`, `RightJoin`, `InnerJoin`, `FullJoin` and their alias variants
- Modified SQL generation to include JOIN clauses in the `buildSelect()` method
- Created comprehensive test suite covering all basic operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and new JOIN functionality
- Added performance benchmarks for all query types
- Updated documentation (README.md, QWEN.md, CLAUDE.md) with new relationship features
- Verified backward compatibility and successful compilation

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Design relationship functionality for the query builder
2. [DONE] Add JoinClause struct to represent JOIN operations
3. [DONE] Add JOIN methods to QueryBuilder (Join, LeftJoin, RightJoin, InnerJoin, FullJoin)
4. [DONE] Modify buildSelect to include JOIN clauses in SQL generation
5. [DONE] Add support for table aliases in queries
6. [DONE] Update QueryBuilder to handle relationship-based WHERE clauses
7. [DONE] Add examples and documentation for relationship functionality
8. [DONE] Create comprehensive test suite for all basic query operations
9. [DONE] Add performance benchmarks for all query types
10. [DONE] Verify backward compatibility and successful compilation
