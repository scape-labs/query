# Relationship Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully extended the query builder to support relationship functionality through JOIN operations, enabling users to build complex queries that span multiple related tables.

## Features Added

### 1. JoinClause Struct
- Added a new `JoinClause` struct to represent JOIN operations
- Contains fields for `Type`, `Table`, `Alias`, and `Condition`

### 2. JOIN Methods
Added comprehensive JOIN support to the QueryBuilder:
- `Join(table, condition string)` - Standard JOIN
- `LeftJoin(table, condition string)` - LEFT JOIN
- `RightJoin(table, condition string)` - RIGHT JOIN
- `InnerJoin(table, condition string)` - INNER JOIN
- `FullJoin(table, condition string)` - FULL JOIN
- `JoinAs(table, alias, condition string)` - JOIN with alias
- `LeftJoinAs(table, alias, condition string)` - LEFT JOIN with alias
- `RightJoinAs(table, alias, condition string)` - RIGHT JOIN with alias
- `InnerJoinAs(table, alias, condition string)` - INNER JOIN with alias
- `FullJoinAs(table, alias, condition string)` - FULL JOIN with alias

### 3. Table Aliasing
- Added `As(alias string)` method to set table aliases
- Extended JOIN methods to support table aliases

### 4. SQL Generation
- Modified `buildSelect()` to include JOIN clauses in SQL generation
- Properly handles table aliases in FROM and JOIN clauses

## Implementation Details

### Struct Modifications
- Added `joinClauses []*JoinClause` field to `QueryBuilder`
- Added `tableAlias string` field to `QueryBuilder`

### Code Changes
- Updated `NewQueryBuilder()` to initialize joinClauses slice
- Modified SQL generation to include JOIN clauses
- Added proper alias support in FROM and JOIN clauses

## Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for all JOIN operations
- Verified functionality with multiple test cases
- All tests passing successfully

## Documentation
- Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation
- Updated QWEN.md with detailed technical information
- Updated CLAUDE.md with implementation details
- Added example code demonstrating usage

## Examples

### Simple JOIN
```go
qb := NewQueryBuilder().
    Table("users").
    Select("users.id", "users.name", "accounts.name as account_name").
    LeftJoin("accounts", "accounts.id = users.account_id").
    Where("users.active", "=", true)
```

### Multiple JOINs with Aliases
```go
qb := NewQueryBuilder().
    Table("posts").
    As("p").
    Select("p.title", "u.name as author", "c.name as category").
    LeftJoinAs("users", "u", "u.id = p.user_id").
    InnerJoinAs("categories", "c", "c.id = p.category_id").
    Where("p.published", "=", true).
    OrderBy("p.created_at").
    Limit(10)
```

## Benefits
1. **Enhanced Query Building**: Users can now build complex queries involving related tables
2. **Flexible JOIN Operations**: Support for all common JOIN types
3. **Table Aliasing**: Improved query readability with table aliases
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
5. **Consistent API**: New methods follow the same fluent interface pattern

This implementation brings the query builder to feature parity with more complex ORM query builders while maintaining its lightweight and simple nature.
